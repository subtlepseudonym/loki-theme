Put the contents of this repo into your oh-my-zsh custom folder. The default path for this directory is ${HOME}/.oh-my-zsh/custom

You may need to change the colors of your terminal around to make it more palatable because my home setup (for which this was created) has some odd color settings. You can find my color settings for urxvt and xterm in <a href="https://github.com/subtlepseudonym/custom-envs/tree/master/Xresources/.Xresources.d">custom-envs</a>, which may help.

Enjoy
